Séverin is Associate Professor in Social Robotics and AI at the Bristol Robotics Lab. His research interest primarily concerns the socio-cognitive aspects of human-robot interaction, both from the perspective of the human cognition and the design of cognitive architectures for the robots.  He has been focusing his recent experimental work on human-in-the-loop machine learning for social robots, with applications in child-robot interactions and assistive robotics, with the goal to develop effective and engaging novel interaction paradigms, in particular in education.
