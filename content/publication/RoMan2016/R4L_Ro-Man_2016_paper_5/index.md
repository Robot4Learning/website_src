abstract: In this paper I present a microanalytical sequential analysis of people's interactions with a small humanoid robot, in which they play a word formation game together. The analysis reveals two ways of engaging with the robot and suggests that interactional repair during an interaction initiated by the robot can lead to more engaging behaviors in people interacting with it.
