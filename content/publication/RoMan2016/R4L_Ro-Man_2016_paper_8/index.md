abstract: That “practice makes perfect” is a powerful heuristic for improving performance through repetition. This is widely used in educational context, and as such provides a potentially useful feature for application to child-robot interactions in educational contexts. While this effect may intuitively appear to be present, we here describe data to provide evidence in support of this supposition. Conducting a descriptive analysis of data from a wider study, we specifically examine the effect on child performance of repeating a previously performed collaborative task with a robot if initial performance is low. The results generally indicate a positive effect on performance through repetition, and a number of other correlation effects that highlight the role of individual differences. This outcome provides evidence for the variable utility of repetition between individuals, but also highlights that this is driven by the individual, and can nevertheless result in performance improvements even in the context of peer-peer interactions (i.e. no expert guiding agent present) with sparse feedback.
