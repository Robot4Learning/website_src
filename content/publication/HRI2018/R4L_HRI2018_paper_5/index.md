abstract: ISEP-R0B0 is a project which combines a small programmable robot and a visual programming language. Its goal is to provide a full-fledged system at a very low cost, targeting schools but also informal learning situations such as after-class activities. Through the programming and observation of the behavior of the robot, students can learn notions either related to Computer Science or Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Since ISEP-R0B0 is still at an early age, this article focuses on introducing the design of the system and two case studies we plan on conducting shortly.
