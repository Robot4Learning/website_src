abstract: "In the present article, we investigate children's perceptions of a robot in a one-to-one 'learning-by-teaching' scenario where a robot acts as a 'learner' and a child as a 'tutor'. The child interacts with the robot in multiple-sessions. The robot exhibits varied learning competencies under three conditions: 'continuous-learning'; 'non-learning'; and 'personalised-learning'. The preliminary results indicate that the robot's competencies did not affect children's perception of the robot's social role but affected their perception of robot's intelligence."
