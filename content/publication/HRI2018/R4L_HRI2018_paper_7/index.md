abstract: Due to the high intensity and repetitiveness of the exercises, rehabilitation process may be frustrating for the patients and it may results with poor treatment results. One promising way to increase motivation to provide social support through game-play. In this paper we provide an overview of previous work on collaborative and competitive games designed for rehabilitation and try to figure out current needs of the area to increase the usability of inter-player rehabilitation games. We also discussed the use of tangibles in rehabilitation and collaborative learning and raised an idea of designing collaborative scripting components for rehabilitation game design by drawing inspiration from collaborative learning.
