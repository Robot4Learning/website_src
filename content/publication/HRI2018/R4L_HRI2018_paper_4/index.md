abstract: To broaden the adoption and be more inclusive, robotic tutors need to tailor their behaviours to their audience. Traditional approaches, such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, try to adapt the content of lessons or the difficulty of tasks to the current estimated knowledge of the student. However, these variations only happen in a limited domain, predefined in advance, and are not able to tackle unexpected variation in a student's behaviours. We argue that robot adaptation needs to go beyond variations in preprogrammed behaviours and that robots should in effect learn online how to become better tutors. A study is currently being carried out to evaluate how human supervision can teach a robot to support child learning during an educational game using one implementation of this approach.
