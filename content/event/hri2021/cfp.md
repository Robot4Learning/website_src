# Submission Guidelines
We invite participants to report previous or planned research, practice and interest in developing applications in social robots for learning. Researchers from HRI, robotics and educational backgrounds are invited to contribute.

Authors are invited to **submit a case study on which they will be working during the workshop**. To present their case study, we ask them to answer a few questions in line with the units of the workshop. During the workshop, they will present to their peers their answer/implementation of the concepts for each unit and receive feedback. Priority will be given to case studies which are complementary, and which offer a range of theoretical and cultural perspectives.


## Questions

### 1. Background and Research questions
What research question are you trying to address?

What learning theory or theortical background do you plan to use?
### 2. Design
What is the context to your research?
- Who are your learners?
- What are the learning objectives?
- Where is the learning occuring? (home, school, elderly facility ...)
- What robot do you use and why?
### 3. Assessment
What methods do you plan to use for the assessment?
How do they map with the learning objectives?


## Submission format
Please submit your answers to the above questions in a 2-4 pages document using the template available here: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/style-and-template-for-preprints-arxiv-bio-arxiv/fxsnsrzpnvwc 
The submissions are done via the online form:
