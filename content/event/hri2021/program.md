# Provisional schedule  
We present below the schedule for the workshop. Depending on the registered participants, we will align the schedule to the adequate time zones. We also investigate the possibility of having the workshop in several instances to suit several time zones. The keynotes times will be fixed, but the rest is kept open depending on participants.
